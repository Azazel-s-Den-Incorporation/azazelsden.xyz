Thoughts - 28 04 2024


I lay here suffering in my lowly lair,
a hole in my chest as it aches in pain,
wanting to feel the warm tenderness of another,
for it to stay ever so far from reach.


I feel every beat of my heart in my chest,
pumping with strain as I am so stressed out,
many things are causing me to feel pain,
many are unable to be helped.


I create and do so much yet many do not see,
those who do are either envious, unimpressed or show what feels like pity.


The future is so uncertain and terrifying,
my own homeland turning in on itself,
my own life teetering in a delicate balance,
my own heart broken yet longing to love again.


I am in a great deal of pain.
Ive been hit, screamed at, belittled, used, attacked, manipulated, but despite it all I laugh and make light of a terrible situation.
I try and try but the pain persists.


Tell those around you that you care about that you love them more often; it could save their life.
